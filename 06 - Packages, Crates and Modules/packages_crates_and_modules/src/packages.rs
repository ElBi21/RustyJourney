/// **Packages and Crates**
///
/// In Rust, a **crate** is the smallest amount of code that is considered at a time, during compile
/// time, by the Rust compiler. It comes in two types:
///  - **Binary crate**: it's a crate that compiles to a runnable executable, and it could be a
///                      command line program or, for instance, a server. Each binary crate has its
///                      own `main()` function;
///  - **Library crate**: this kind of crate doesn't have any `main()` function, but it's instead
///                       meant to hold extensible functions (an example could be the `Matplotlib`
///                       package for `Python`).
/// The word **crate** is mostly used to refer to **library crates**
